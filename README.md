## [TELEWORK ADOPTION IN TIMES OF PANDEMIC](https://github.com/fernandofsilva/Articles/blob/main/notebooks/telework_adoption_in_time_of_pandemic.ipynb)

**ABSTRACT**
This article presents the results of an online research survey that aimed to quantify aspects of the sudden adoption of telework in the scenario of the Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil. The analysis used the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) via a statistical model to test hypotheses. The survey involving 652 respondents distributed in all the Brazilian macro-regions took place from April 2nd to 10th, 2020 when the respondents had been doing telework mode for an average 17.5 days. The study concluded that even though people declare they have the technological tools to perform the telework, they also face difficulties in using them, in establishing a new work routine and have doubts regarding company productivity and employment stability in this scenario. Other identified difficulties were related to behavioral issues and organizational management.  
Key words: Telework. Pandemic. Covid-19. Technology Adoption. Information and Communication Technology.
